## What Is a Cable?

A Cable is a short, factual situational awareness document intended to be:

- Read quickly
- Shared safely
- Verified independently
- Preserved across formats

Cables are not alerts and do not tell you what to do.
They exist to help people understand what is happening.

## What a Cable Is Not

A Cable is not:

- Breaking news
- Speculation
- Opinion
- A call to action
- A warning system

If information is uncertain, the Cable will say so.

## How to Verify a Cable

Every Cable contains three verification elements:

1. The text
2. A MicroCode seal
3. An Aztec link

To verify:

- Read the document
- Check the MicroCode for the cable ID, time, and hash
- Scan the code to compare with the canonical copy

If the text and hash do not match, the document has been altered.

## Why This Format Exists

Cables are designed to survive:

- Printing
- Screenshots
- Sharing
- Archiving
- Partial loss of infrastructure

They do not rely on trust in a platform, only consistency.

## Who Publishes Cables

MSPMetro publishes Cables to provide calm, factual awareness of local events that affect daily life.
