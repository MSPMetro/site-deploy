# MSPMetro Source Box: configured sources/endpoints
#
# This file is the canonical place to declare sources the Source Box should ingest.
# It is applied to the database via:
#   python -m mspmetro_backend sync-sources --file backend/config/sources.toml
#
# Notes:
# - This is configuration, not data; keep it small and explicit.
# - Add new sources here (name + tier + endpoints) before implementing ingestion logic.
